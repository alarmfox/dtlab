Welcome to the Shell Game!
Your tasks:
1. Create a directory inside game_data named 'level1'.
2. Inside 'level1', create a file named 'task.txt' and write 'Shell Game' in it.
3. Change the permissions of 'task.txt' to read-only.
4. Find the hidden message in '.secret' and write it to 'secret_message.txt' in 'game_data'.

Good luck!
