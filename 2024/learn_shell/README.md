# Learn Linux Shell


## Anatomy of a Command

A Linux command typically consists of three parts:

1. **Command**: The action you want to perform.
2. **Options**: Flags or modifiers to change the behavior of the command.
3. **Arguments**: Additional information required by the command to execute.

An example command structure looks like this:

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

Now, let's delve into some essential commands:

```bash
ls [options] [directory]
```

**Options**:

- `-l`: Long format, displaying detailed information.
- `-a`: Include hidden files and directories starting with a dot.
- `-h`: Human-readable sizes.

Example:

```bash

```

## The `cd` Command

The `cd` command is used to change directories.

```bash
